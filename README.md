## API Routes

The `pages/api` directory contains API routes for server-side logic. Example:

- `pages/api/products.ts`: Fetch all products.
- `pages/api/cart.ts`: Handle cart operations.

These APIs are accessible at `/api/*`. Customize or extend them as needed.

## Deployment

1. Push your project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Connect your repository to Vercel.
3. Follow the steps to deploy. Vercel will handle builds and hosting.
